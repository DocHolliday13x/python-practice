# python-practice

This is my repository for practicing python. I will be adding more and more python scripts as I learn more about the language. I will also be adding some of my old python scripts that I have written in the past. I hope you find this repository useful.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have python installed on your machine. You can download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository
3. Run the python script you want to run (my basic server is called app.py)

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/) - The web framework used
